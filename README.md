Web Scraping, Data Processing, and Storage Pipeline

This repository contains a project demonstrating how to:
Use Beautiful Soup for web scraping.
Leverage AWS Lambda for serverless data processing.
Store scraped and processed data in AWS S3 as a data lake.
Transform and clean the data for downstream use.

Introduction

This project demonstrates an end-to-end workflow for scraping data from the web, processing it using a serverless approach with AWS Lambda, and storing it in an S3 bucket as a data lake. The focus is on automation, scalability, and efficient data transformation.
Process Flow
Web Scraping: Collect data from websites using Beautiful Soup.
Data Processing: Transform and clean the scraped data using Python.
Serverless Deployment: Use AWS Lambda for processing without managing servers.
Data Storage: Save the cleaned data in AWS S3 for further analysis
Getting Started with AWS
To replicate this pipeline, ensure you have:
An AWS account.
Permissions to create and manage Lambda functions, S3 buckets, and IAM roles.
Overview of the Pipeline
Key Components
Web Scraping:
Use Beautiful Soup to extract structured data from a target website.
AWS Lambda:
A serverless function processes and transforms the data.
AWS S3:
A scalable storage service acts as the data lake for storing output files.
IAM Roles:
Grant necessary permissions to the Lambda function for accessing S3.
High-Level Architecture
Trigger: Lambda function is triggered on-demand or by a scheduled event.
Execution: Scraped data is processed and cleaned within the Lambda function.
Storage: Processed data is uploaded to a specified S3 bucket.

Implementation
Writing the Web Scraping Function
Use Beautiful Soup to extract relevant data from target web pages.
Clean and transform the data for analysis.
Refer to web_scraping.py for implementation details.
Creating the S3 Bucket
Navigate to the S3 console in AWS.
Create a new bucket to store processed data.

Enable versioning and configure permissions as needed.

Setting Up the Lambda Function

Write the Lambda function in Python.

Package dependencies (e.g., Beautiful Soup) using a deployment package or container.

Upload the function code to AWS Lambda.

Configuring IAM Roles

Create an IAM role with S3 access policies.

Attach the role to your Lambda function.

Triggering the Pipeline

Configure an event source (e.g., CloudWatch Events or API Gateway).

Test the pipeline by invoking the Lambda function.

Conclusion

This project showcases how to integrate web scraping with AWSâ€™s serverless and storage services to build a scalable data processing pipeline. The pipeline can be extended further by integrating with downstream analytics tools or machine learning models.
